# IJV_simulation project
Actually, we can split the process in three main phase..
1. surrogate-based Monte Carlo (using ANN model to replace MC) --> you can see related code in the folder "**ANN forward model**"
2. ANN based prediction model --> you can see related code in the folder "**ANN prediction model**"
3. robustness of our prediction model --> you can see related code in the folder "**mcx bound test**"

Also, about how to start simulating MC you can see related code in the folder "**mcx_sim**"

The process of this project is like below picture
